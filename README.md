# emotion-based-music


<h1>Description</h1>
Welcome to new project emotion based music built by using mediapipe and keras. also opencv and streamlit is used to create a webapp. for capturing the webcam in the browser i used streamlit-webrtc module. I explained all of the code in this video which is required to create a webapp for emotion based music recommender.

Project Overview
This emotion-based music recommender is built using machine learning and computer vision technologies including MediaPipe and Keras. The system captures your live video feed using OpenCV and Streamlit to analyze facial expressions and classify emotions.

To enable webcam capture directly in the browser, the project leverages the Streamlit-webrtc module for seamless, real-time processing. The emotion classification model is adapted from a live emoji recognition project, trained to detect various emotions.

Key Technologies Used
MediaPipe: For facial landmark detection and face analysis.

Keras: Deep learning framework used to build the emotion classification model.

OpenCV: For image processing and webcam interfacing.

Streamlit: To create an interactive web application.

Streamlit-webrtc: For capturing and streaming webcam video in the browser.

Features
Real-time emotion detection from webcam.

Emotion-driven music recommendations.

Interactive web interface for user-friendly experience.
